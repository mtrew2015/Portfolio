# Portfolio
Personal Portfolio Site For Michael Trew

### Hello
Welcome to my Portfolio site Github repo. I strive to write great code, and create beautiful and functional web apps. If I can assist you with your next project or if you're looking to hire a web developer, please reach out to me at mtrew2015@gmail.com

### Front End Framework
I used React JS since it's just a great framework for combining JavaScript and HTML into a nice, clean, single page application. It works really well in a dynamic porfolio situation.

I have styled the page using Node-SASS since it works seamlessly with React JS and it makes styling more streamlined and straightforward.

** This is not my current portfolio ** for my currently deployed portfolio the web address is michael-trew.netlify.com, it will be moving to a different domain soon.
